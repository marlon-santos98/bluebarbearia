<h1>Hi Everyone ðŸª’</h1>

<p>This is a project created to a barber shop, the owner is my friend and him didnÂ´t have a site yet. So I offered to create a landing page about your bussines and him accepted.</p>
<p>I used HTML and CSS at this project and I learn how to manipulate videos and images of a more professional shape. The site is responsive to all devices and the design was created with base in many other sites, I got ideas of design of each site that I considered be relavant.</p>
<p>I learned that is very important empower small bussines, it's very important that they are on internet.</p>
